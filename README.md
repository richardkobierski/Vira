# Vira
Vira is a lightweight Discord music bot that plays music on YouTube.
# Commands
/join - Joins the user's voice channel.
/leave - Leaves the user's voice channel.
/play - Plays a song in the voice channel.
/pause - Pauses music at the current time.
/resume - Resumes playing music at paused time.
/queue - Shows the user's queue
# Features
1. Discord bots can leave a lot of chat clutter when users constantly execute commands. Vira helps by making sure there is as little chat clutter as possible by automatically removing non-critical messages after a few seconds. 
2. Other music bots take up a lot of local storage because they download the songs before playing them. Vira does not; it streams the music directly from YouTube itself!
3. Each time a new session is started, Vira creates its own music controller inside the channel, allowing users to use reactions to pause, play, or skip a song!
